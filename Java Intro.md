-  A Java programmer creates a program.
- The JAVAC compiler, which is a primary Java compiler provided in the Java development kit (JDK), is used to compile the code. It accepts a Java application as input and outputs bytecode.
- JVM runs the bytecode generated by the compiler during the program’s Running phase.![[Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 6.31.46 PM.png]]
- **JRE:** The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is included with the JDK. The JRE installation on our computers allows us to run the Java program, but we cannot compile it. A browser, JVM, applet support, and plugins are all included in JRE. JRE is required for a computer to run a Java program.
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** When we learn about bytecode and JVM, we use the name JDK. As the name implies, it is a complete Java development kit that includes everything from the compiler to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), debuggers, and documentation. In order to design, compile, and run the java application, we must first install JDK on our computer. ![[Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 6.33.39 PM.png]]![[Screenshot 2024-05-28 at 6.33.59 PM.png]]
- **Garbage Collection:** Garbage collection is the technique through which Java programs maintain their memory automatically. Java programs are compiled into bytecode that may be executed by a Java Virtual Machine, or JVM. Objects are produced on the heap, which is a part of memory devoted to the Java application, while it runs on the JVM. Some objects will become obsolete over time. To free up memory, the garbage collector detects these useless objects and deletes them
